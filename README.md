# Design System Tools

This is a monorepo for a collection of tools to help you build and maintain a design system.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses yarn as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `documentation-pilot`: a VS Code extension to help you link code to documentation
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
